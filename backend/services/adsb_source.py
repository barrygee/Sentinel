"""Claiming and tuning the Sentry dongle that feeds Off Grid ADS-B.

Off Grid air data used to be a URL and nothing else, which left the actual
receiver anonymous: Sentinel knew where to *read* aircraft from, but not which
dongle produced the samples, so it could neither tune it nor stop anything else
retuning it. The map went empty and said nothing about why.

This resolves `air.offgridSdrSource` — a `{sentry_host_id, sentry_device_id}`
pair — into a live Sentry device, claims it, and tunes it to 1090 MHz in one
step. See Sentinel ADR-0003.

**Tuning travels with the claim, never after it.** Two calls would leave a
window where the device is ours but still on the wrong frequency, and a second
request that can fail on its own means handling "claimed but not tuned" — a
state nothing wants to be in and nothing would clean up.

AGC is the obvious choice and the wrong one here. ADS-B is a burst mode: each

automatic gain control cannot track anything that short — it settles for the
*silence*, which is to say it settles low, and the pulses that matter arrive
below the noise floor. Every ADS-B decoder's own guidance starts at maximum gain
for this reason.

49.6 dB is the R820T's top step. An aerial close to an airport can overload at

nearer — the fix there is a lower fixed gain, not AGC."""
