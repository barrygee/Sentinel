"""Per-Sentry-host poller — caches each enabled host's live device status (ADR-0009).

One asyncio task per **enabled** `SentryHost` row polls `GET /api/status` on an
interval, caching the latest snapshot in memory so router reads never block on
a remote round-trip to a Raspberry Pi that may be slow or off the network. On
failure the poller backs off exponentially rather than hammering an
unreachable host — the same shape as
`backend.radio_hub.services.sdr.RadioBroadcaster._reconnect`. `last_seen_at`/`last_error`
are mirrored onto the host's DB row so the UI can show reachability without
polling itself.

A single process-wide `fleet_poller` instance is created here and
started/stopped from `backend.main`'s lifespan, matching the existing
`_daily_cleanup_loop` pattern (create the task at startup, cancel-and-await it
at shutdown).
