"""Typed async HTTP client for one Sentry host's management API (ADR-0009).

Sentry stays the source of truth for SDR device configuration; Sentinel is a
full remote client of its existing `/api` surface. This module is that
client — one instance per Sentry host, built from a `backend.models.SentryHost`
row. It does not reimplement any of Sentry's validation (port allocation, name
uniqueness, device state) — it only shapes the HTTP call and translates the
response into either a value or one of two typed errors, so a caller can
always tell "the Pi was unreachable" apart from "Sentry rejected the request".

Security notes:
- `address` is operator input used to build a URL, so it is validated against
  a strict hostname/IPv4 allow-list before ever reaching httpx — no scheme, no
  embedded credentials, no path, no port suffix (the port is a separate,
  independently-bounded field).
- The bearer token is never logged, never included in an exception message,
  and never echoed back by any caller of this module.
