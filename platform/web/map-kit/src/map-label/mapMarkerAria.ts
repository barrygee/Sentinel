 * marker whose element carries a real name has to restore it *after* it is
 * added, or a screen reader hears a map full of identical "Map marker"s.
 *
 * Only for markers that are genuinely their own object to a screen-reader user
 * (a Sentry site, a count standing for several). A marker whose element already
 * exposes its own text needs no name of its own.
