"""ADS-B decoder sidecar supervisor.

Pulls the raw I/Q stream from a remote Sentry `rtl_tcp` port, feeds it to
readsb, and serves the resulting ``aircraft.json`` over HTTP for Sentinel's Off
Grid air source to poll.

The pipeline, and why each piece is there::

    socat TCP:<sentry>:<port>  →  strip 12-byte RTL0 header  →  readsb (ifile)
                                                                     ↓
                                          /run/adsb/aircraft.json  →  HTTP

``rtl_tcp`` opens every connection with a 12-byte header — the magic ``RTL0``,
then the tuner type and gain-stage count. readsb's ``ifile`` mode expects
nothing but samples, so those 12 bytes have to go: left in place they are read
as I/Q and put a burst of nonsense at the head of the stream.

**This container never tunes the dongle.** An rtl_tcp client normally sets the
centre frequency and sample rate itself over the same socket, but on a Sentry
those are the operator's own per-device settings and a client that quietly
retuned them would be changing what another consumer is receiving. The dongle
must therefore already be set to **1090 MHz at 2.4 MSPS** in Sentry; anything
else decodes to silence, which is why that is checked and logged at startup
rather than left to be discovered from an empty map.

Uses only the Python standard library so the runtime image stays minimal.

Environment:
    CONFIG_URL                    Sentinel's `/api/sdr/adsb/config`, polled for the
                                  rtl_tcp endpoint. Preferred over RTL_TCP_HOST/PORT
    RTL_TCP_HOST / RTL_TCP_PORT   static fallback when CONFIG_URL is unset or silent
    JSON_DIR                      where readsb writes aircraft.json
    HTTP_PORT                     port this process serves JSON_DIR on
    SENTRY_API_BASE               optional; polled once at startup to report
                                  what the source device is tuned to
    READSB_EXTRA_ARGS             optional extra readsb args (space-separated)
