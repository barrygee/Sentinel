 * the filter accordion is expanded, and a `filterFrequencies` helper that
 * narrows a frequency list to the selection. Extracted out of
 * `SdrFrequencyManagerTab.vue` unchanged in behaviour, paired with the
 * presentational `SdrFrequencyGroupFilter.vue`.
 *
 * Note on behaviour worth keeping deliberate: a selected group that stops
 * being offered by the chips (e.g. its last frequency was reassigned) is NOT
 * pruned from the selection — the list keeps showing "No matches." until the
 * user clicks "All", which the Frequency Manager's specs pin.
 *
 * @param freqGroupsFor - resolves a stored frequency to the groups it
 *   belongs to (the store's `freqGroupsFor`, or an equivalent).
