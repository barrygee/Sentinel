/**
 * `SdrFavouriteStar` — the per-row favourite/unfavourite toggle used by both
 * the Frequency Manager (starring) and the FAVOURITES list (unstarring).
 * Wraps `BaseIconAction` for its active/disabled/accessible-name contract and
 * adds a state-reflecting accessible name so a screen-reader user hears which
 * frequency the press affects and what pressing it will do.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT the military star used in the Air/Space filter rails
 * (`shared/FilterSubTabIcon.vue`, `air/AirSideMenu.vue`) — that glyph is a
 * fixed 5-point outline star (fill:none, stroke-width:1.4, inner/outer radius
 * ratio ~0.35, tightly pointed). This star differs three ways: it FILLS solid
 * (`fill="currentColor"`) when favourited instead of staying an outline (the
 * fill state doubles as the toggle's own affordance), it turns the panel's
 * lime accent (see `.sdr-freq-row-fav-active` in SdrPanel.css) rather than the
 * row's muted
 * grey, and its points are fuller/fatter (inner/outer radius ratio ~0.48,
 * heavier 1.6 stroke) with a distinct hand-authored vertex set — never a
 * shared glyph, so there is no name collision or accidental restyle risk.
