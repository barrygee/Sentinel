/**
 * `SdrFrequencyRowSummary` — the read-only saved-frequency row body (label,

 * verbatim (byte-identical `.sdr-freq-row-*` classes) from the Frequency
 * Manager so it and the FAVOURITES list render the exact same row chrome
 * instead of a copy-pasted block — existing CSS and specs targeting these
 * classes keep matching unchanged.
 *
 * The trailing button cluster is the caller's concern via the `#actions`
 * slot, since the two hosts offer different actions (the manager: favourite,
 * tune, edit, remove; FAVOURITES: unfavourite, tune). This component only
 * owns the cluster's wrapper, so the buttons group tightly regardless of who
 * fills the slot.
