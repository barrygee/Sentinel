"""Tests for mirrored radios tracking their Sentry device, rather than going stale.

A Sentinel radio created from a Sentry device is a *mirror*: the device identity
is the fact, and the address is a detail Sentry owns and reassigns. Replug a
dongle into a different USB socket and Sentry may hand it a different output
port — at which point the mirror points at a port nothing listens on.

Before this, that surfaced as `POST /api/sdr/connect` failing with a bare socket
error naming neither the device nor the reason. Two behaviours prevent it:

* the poller re-points radios at wherever their device now answers;
* an unavailable device is *reported* as such, so the UI can grey the radio out
  and a connection attempt explains itself.

Run with:  uv run --project backend pytest tests/backend/test_sentry_radio_following.py
