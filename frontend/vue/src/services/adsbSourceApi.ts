/**
 * Typed client for `/api/sdr/adsb` — the Sentry dongle behind Off Grid ADS-B.
 *
 * Off Grid air data has two halves that used to be unrelated: a URL to read
 * aircraft from, and the SDR that produced the samples. This is the second —
 * naming that SDR, claiming it while AIR is watching, and tuning it to
 * 1090 MHz. See Sentinel ADR-0003.
 *
 * Errors are returned rather than thrown. Every caller here is a background
 * lifecycle step — a claim on view entry, a renewal on a timer — where an
 * exception has nobody to catch it and would surface as an unhandled rejection
 * in the console instead of a message in the UI. The claim's failure *is* the
 * information the operator needs, so it is data.
