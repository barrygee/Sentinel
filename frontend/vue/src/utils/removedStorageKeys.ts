/**
 * One-time cleanup of localStorage keys written by features that no longer
 * exist.
 *
 * The SDR store caches its settings in localStorage so the first render is
 * correct before the async settings fetch resolves. When a feature is removed,
 * its cached keys stay in every browser that ever ran the old build — nothing
 * reads them, but they resurface in any manual inspection of the app's storage
 * and are indistinguishable there from live state. The backend counterpart is
 * `prune_removed_settings()` in `backend/database.py`, which drops the same
 * features' rows from the settings table.
