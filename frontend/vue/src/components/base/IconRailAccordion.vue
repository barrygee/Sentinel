 * `IconRailAccordion` — the click-to-expand sub-panel mechanic shared by the

 * `useDisclosure`) and the panel's show/hide + layout; callers own the

 * behaviour those buttons perform on click.
 *
 * The open/closed flag is transient UI state local to this component

 * project's state-placement rule) it stays out of Pinia, exactly as it did
 * when `SpaceSideMenu`/`AirSideMenu` called `useDisclosure()` directly.

/* Touch screens: hover tooltips aren't useful (mirrors IconRail's identical
   rule — see the NOTE in IconRail.vue's own <style> for why this is
   duplicated rather than inherited). IconRailAccordion has two template
   roots (the trigger slot output + this panel div), so it is a multi-root
   component; Vue's scoped-CSS slot-scope-id propagation bails out for
   multi-root components, meaning IconRail's own `:slotted([data-tooltip])`
   rule never reaches the trigger button or panel buttons rendered here —
   only content slotted directly into IconRail itself. This component must
   therefore repeat the suppression for its own slot children (the MAP
   LAYERS/FILTER trigger button and its panel's sub-buttons), or a tap on any
   of them leaves a stuck tooltip pill on touch devices at ≤768px. */
