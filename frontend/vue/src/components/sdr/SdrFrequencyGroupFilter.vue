/**
 * `SdrFrequencyGroupFilter` — the GROUPS pill-filter accordion, lifted
 * verbatim (DOM + classes unchanged) from the Frequency Manager so both it
 * and the FAVOURITES list render the identical filter chrome instead of a
 * copy-pasted block. Purely presentational: the selection state lives in
 * `useFrequencyGroupFilter`, instantiated separately by each host so their
 * filters stay independent.
 *
 * `bodyId` is a required prop (not defaulted) because `BaseAccordionSection`
 * writes it straight into the DOM as the body's real `id` and into the
 * header's `aria-controls` — a plain correctness requirement, not a defence
 * against a live duplication bug (only one `<SdrPanel>` is ever mounted,
 * `App.vue` → `SdrTabPanel.vue`): every instance still needs its own unique
 * id, since this component is instantiated twice in that single mount (once
 * by the Frequency Manager, once by FAVOURITES). The Frequency Manager keeps
 * `sdr-freq-manager-groups-section`; FAVOURITES uses
 * `sdr-favourites-groups-section`.
