/**
 * Shared proximity clustering for map markers.
 *
 * Two map layers now face the same problem — APRS stations on Land, and Sentry
 * sites on every domain map: several points close enough together that their
 * markers land on top of each other and the map reads as holding fewer things
 * than it does. Both answer it the same way, with one numbered marker standing
 * for the huddle that opens when clicked, so the grouping rule and the marker
 * that draws it live here rather than in either caller.
 *
 * Deliberately screen-space, not geographic: whether two markers collide is a
 * question about pixels at the current zoom, so callers project their points
 * and pass the results in.
