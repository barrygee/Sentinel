/**
 * Picks which Sentry SDR produces the samples behind Off Grid ADS-B.
 *
 * The Off Grid *URL* beside this says where to read decoded aircraft from; this
 * says which dongle produced them. They are separate facts — a decoder can sit
 * anywhere — and until this existed the receiver was anonymous, so Sentinel
 * could neither tune it to 1090 MHz nor stop anything else retuning it. See
 * ADR-0003.
 *
 * Devices come from the Sentry hosts already registered in Settings → SDR, so
 * there is nothing to type: an operator picks the dongle they already named.
 * Saved immediately on change rather than staged with the panel's other
 * settings, because the AIR view acts on it the moment it is set, and a choice
 * that only took effect on some later Save would look broken in between.
