 * Settings > Range Ring Origin — the durable copy of the choice the map rail

 *
 * The row itself is only the frame: the picker owns the choices, and each of
 * its rows already carries the coordinates it would centre on, so the section
 * needs no separate readout of where the rings currently are.
 *
 * The choice takes effect on the map immediately, but the write to the config
 * database is staged (`stage`) so APPLY CHANGES reports SAVED rather than
 * "NO CHANGES".
