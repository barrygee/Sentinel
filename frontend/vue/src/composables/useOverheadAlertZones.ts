/**
 * Every place overhead alerts can watch, with its own settings resolved.
 *
 * A Sentry watches its own patch of sky, so "is anything overhead?" is asked
 * once per receiver rather than once for the app. The operator's own position
 * leads the list — it is the one place that exists before any Sentry does — and
 * each Sentry follows in fleet order.
 *
 * Used by the two things that need the same answer: the background alert
 * service, which decides what to notify about, and the Air map, which draws a
 * zone for each. Both call this, so the zones and the alerts cannot disagree.
 *
 * Everything here derives from stores, so there is nothing to memoise — each
 * caller gets its own computed over the same reactive sources. (Holding one
 * shared computed would pin the store instances it first resolved, which is a
 * trap the moment a second pinia exists.)
